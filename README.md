Here, we present a collection of demo codes used to support our research, including:

- kNN and SVR models for solid and liquid substances
- SVR and DFNN models for biomarker analysis

These codes are organized into corresponding folders. Detailed descriptions, environment configurations, and parameter settings can also be found in their respective files. The analysis typically completes within a few minutes on a standard desktop computer.
