Here, we present a collection of demo codes used to support our research, including:

- Convolutional recovery of unknown spectra
- kNN and SVR models for solid and liquid substances
- SVR and DFNN models for biomarker analysis

These codes are currently accessible **only to editors and reviewers** during the peer-review period. They will be made public once the paper has been published.
